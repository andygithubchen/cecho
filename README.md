# cecho #

Colorful echo for unix-like shell ( ascii color only )

----------

## Overview ##

A **light**, **self-adapting** wrapper of `echo`, with color flags of **foreground**, **background** and **action** ( highlight, underline, blink ... ) . With it, you can easily colorize your output of command and shell script.

Tested in [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

## Install ##

Before use `cecho`, simply source it in your .zshrc, or any shell script wanted to colorize like this: `source /path/to/cecho.sh`

## Usage ##

Support multi-string in one command:

	cecho -color1 message1 [ -color2 message2 ... ] [ -done ]

Support setting foreground, background and action

	cecho -fg_color -bg_color -action message [...] [ -done ]

**All flags have two formats, short for convenience, long for readability.**

The short formats is easily memorized, which are nearly just the heads the long formats.

| -bc   |  -b_cyan     |
| -bw   |  -b_white    |

| short |  long        |
| ----- | ------------ |
| -B    |  -blank      |
| -t    |  -tab		   |
| -n    |  -newline    |

#### Functional ####

| short |  long        |
| ----- | ------------ |
| -h    | -help,--help |

## Example ##

##### set fg to red: #####
	
	cecho -r "hello world !"
or

	cecho -red "hello world !"

or

	cecho -r hello -B world -B !

##### blank & tab & newline #####

	cecho -r -t hello -B world -n !

##### set fg to red, bg to yellow, action to highlight and underline: #####

	cecho -r -by -hl "hello world !"

##### set [ red, yellow, highlight & underline ] for "hello", [ cyan, red, reverse ] for "world", [ green, black, blink ] for "!" : #####

	cecho -r -by -hl -ul hello -d -B -c -br -re world -d -B -g -bl !

## Useful Variables ##

#### CECHO_IS_IMPORTED ####

When you source `cecho`, `CECHO_IS_IMPORTED=1` will be exported. 

That meams you can check this var `CECHO_IS_IMPORTED` to confirm if in a no_cecho env or not:

Exp: [This Sence](https://github.com/springlie/cecho#my-script-maybe-runs-in-both-no-cecho-env-and-cecho-env/)

#### CECHO_IS_INACTIVE ####

When you use `cecho` but want it inactive temply, set `CECHO_IS_INACTIVE=1` before calling `cecho`.

**Note**: color and action can be disable by `CECHO_IS_INACTIVE`, but we keep `return`, `blank` and `tab` active, as you wish.

## Sence ##

##### I want my script outputs to file/pipe without color_ctrl chars" #####

Needn't do any change, `cecho` can self-adapting this: colorful for stdout, non-colorful for file/pipe.

##### My script maybe runs in both "no-cecho env" and "cecho env" #####

Unfortunately, you have to write your script like this:

	if [ -z "$CECHO_IS_IMPORTED" ]
	then
		echo hello world
	else
		cecho -r -bg -hl hello -B world
	fi

Or shortly:

	[ -z "$CECHO_IS_IMPORTED" ] && echo "hello world" || cecho -r -bg -hl hello -B world

##### My script uses `cecho` but I want it disabled temply #####

	CECHO_IS_INACTIVE=1
	cecho -r -bg -hl hello world	# <-- now cecho is inactive
	CECHO_IS_INACTIVE=
	cecho -r -bg -hl hello world	# <-- now cecho is active

## Advanced ##

- Action flag `-d` ( same as `-done` ) will **turn off all settings** ( fg, bg and action ), Thus, in **single** command, you have to set flags again to make it work well once there are other strings after `-d`.
- Some special characters ( with centain format ) don't work well, such as `cecho "!"`. It's due to `echo`... use `cecho '!'` or `cecho !` instead.
- It's **not** necessary use `-d` at the begin/end of commands, `cecho` do it automatically.
- Actions can overlaied.

## Thanks ##

Thanks to [https://github.com/jonhiggs/cecho](https://github.com/jonhiggs/cecho), when I completed `cecho` script and try uploading it to github I found this -- with same name and almost same functions ... and then, I got the way to build table in README.md from there.
